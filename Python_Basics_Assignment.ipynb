    "1. Explain the key features of Python that makes it a popular choice for programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular choice for many reasons. Here are some key reasons for which Python is favoured for programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Widely used in the IT industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Readability and Simplicity: Syntax of Python is clear and resembles plain English, making it easy to learn and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Versatility: Python is a general-purpose language, means it can be used for a wide range of applicationsâ€” from web development to data science, automation, and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Extensive Libraries and Frameworks: Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that simplify complex tasks. For example, libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are very much helpful for data analysis and visualization, while Django and Flask are popular for web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Community Support: Python has a large and active community, which means plenty of resources and documentation are available. This support network makes it easier to find solutions to problems and continuously learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Data Science and Machine Learning: Python is the language of choice for many in data science and machine learning due to libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, and PyTorch, which simplify the implementation of complex algorithms and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "g)Cross-Platform: Python is cross-platform, means It can be run Python on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.\n"
